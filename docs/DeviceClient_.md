DeviceClient is linked to an devices.

## API

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

### getSerialNo

Gets the serial number of the device identified by the given serial number. With our API this doesn't really make much sense, but it has been implemented for completeness. *FYI: in the raw ADB protocol you can specify a device in other ways, too.*

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** The serial number of the device.

### getDevicePath

Gets the device path of the device identified by the given serial number.

#### Examples

```javascript
// List devices withPath
import Adb from '@u4/adbkit';
const client = Adb.createClient();
const devices = client.listDevicesWithPaths();
devices.then((devices) => {
    devices.forEach(function (d) {
        console.log('id: ' + d.id);
        console.log('type: ' + d.type);
        console.log('model ' + d.model);
        console.log('path: ' + d.path);
        console.log('product: ' + d.product);
        console.log('transportId: ' + d.transportId + '\n');
    });
});
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<any>** The device path. This corresponds to the device path in `client.listDevicesWithPaths()`.

### getState

Gets the state of the device identified by the given serial number.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** The device state. This corresponds to the device type in `client.listDevices()`.

### getProperties

Retrieves the properties of the device identified by the given serial number. This is analogous to `adb shell getprop`.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Properties>** An object of device properties. Each key corresponds to a device property. Convenient for accessing things like `'ro.product.model'`.

### getFeatures

Retrieves the features of the device identified by the given serial number. This is analogous to `adb shell pm list features`. Useful for checking whether hardware features such as NFC are available (you'd check for `'android.hardware.nfc'`).

#### Examples

```javascript
// Checking for NFC support
import Adb from '@u4/adbkit';

const client = Adb.createClient();

const test = async () => {
    try {
        const devices = await client.listDevices();
        const supportedDevices: string[] = [];
        for (const device of devices) {
            const client = device.client();
            const features = await client.getFeatures(device.id);
            if (features['android.hardware.nfc'])
                supportedDevices.push(device.serial);
        }
        console.log('The following devices support NFC:', supportedDevices);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack);
    }
};
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Features>** An object of device features. Each key corresponds to a device feature, with the value being either `true` for a boolean feature, or the feature value as a string (e.g. `'0x20000'` for `reqGlEsVersion`).

### getPackages

Retrieves the list of packages present on the device. This is analogous to `adb shell pm list packages`. If you just want to see if something's installed, consider using `client.isInstalled()` instead.

#### Parameters

*   `command` **([string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | ArrayLike\<WithToString>)** The shell command to execute. When `String`, the command is run as-is. When `Array`, the elements will be rudimentarily escaped (for convenience, not security) and joined to form a command.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Read the output of an instantaneous command
import Adb from '@u4/adbkit';

try {
  const client = Adb.createClient();
  const devices = await client.listDevices();
  for (const device of devices) {
      const stream = await device.getClient().shell('echo $RANDOM');
      // Use the readAll() utility to read all the content without
      // having to deal with the readable stream. `output` will be a Buffer
      // containing all the output.
      const output = await adb.util.readAll(stream);
      console.log('[%s] %s', device.id, output.toString().trim());
  }
  console.log('Done.');
} catch(err) {
  console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack);
}
```

```javascript
// Progressively read the output of a long-running command and terminate it

import Adb from '@u4/adbkit';

const client = Adb.createClient();
const devices = await client.listDevices()
for (const device of devices) {
  // logcat just for illustration, prefer client.openLogcat in real use 
  const conn = await device.getClient().shell('logcat')
  let line = 0
  conn.on('data', function(data) {
    // here `ps` on the device shows the running logcat process
    console.log(data.toString())
    line += 1
    // close the stream and the running process
    // on the device will be gone, gracefully
    if (line > 100) conn.end()
  });
  conn.on('close', function() {
    // here `ps` on the device shows the logcat process is gone
    console.log('100 lines read already, bye')
  })
 }
console.log('Done.')
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** A readable stream (`Socket` actually) containing the progressive `stdout` of the command. Use with `adb.util.readAll` to get a readable String from it.

### execOut

execute a single shell command and get stdout responce as a buffer of a string.

#### Parameters

*   `command` **([string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | ArrayLike\<WithToString>)** the command to execute

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html)>** 

### reboot

Puts the device into root mode which may be needed by certain shell commands. A remount is generally required after a successful root call. **Note that this will only work if your device supports this feature. Production devices almost never do.**

#### Parameters

*   `type` **RebootType?** 

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### remount

Attempts to remount the `/system` partition in read-write mode. This will usually only work on emulators and developer devices.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### root

Puts the device into root mode which may be needed by certain shell commands. A remount is generally required after a successful root call. **Note that this will only work if your device supports this feature. Production devices almost never do.**

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### trackJdwp

Starts a JDWP tracker for the given device.

Note that as the tracker will keep a connection open, you must call `tracker.end()` if you wish to stop tracking JDWP processes.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<JdwpTracker>** The JDWP tracker, which is an \[`EventEmitter`]\[node-events]. The following events are available:*   **add** **(pid)** Emitted when a new JDWP process becomes available, once per pid.
*   **remove** **(pid)** Emitted when a JDWP process becomes unavailable, once per pid.
*   **changeSet** **(changes, pids)** All changes in a single event.
*   **changes** An object with the following properties always present:     -   **added** An array of pids that were added. Empty if none.
     -   **removed** An array of pids that were removed. Empty if none.*   **pids** All currently active pids (including pids from previous runs).
*   **end** Emitted when the underlying connection ends.
*   **error** **(err)** Emitted if there's an error.

### framebuffer

Fetches the current **raw** framebuffer (i.e. what is visible on the screen) from the device, and optionally converts it into something more usable by using \[GraphicsMagick]\[graphicsmagick]'s `gm` command, which must be available in `$PATH` if conversion is desired. Note that we don't bother supporting really old framebuffer formats such as RGB\_565. If for some mysterious reason you happen to run into a `>=2.3` device that uses RGB\_565, let us know.

Note that high-resolution devices can have quite massive framebuffers. For example, a device with a resolution of 1920x1080 and 32 bit colors would have a roughly 8MB (`1920*1080*4` byte) RGBA framebuffer. Empirical tests point to about 5MB/s bandwidth limit for the ADB USB connection, which means that it can take ~1.6 seconds for the raw data to arrive, or even more if the USB connection is already congested. Using a conversion will further slow down completion.

#### Parameters

*   `format`  The desired output format. Any output format supported by \[GraphicsMagick]\[graphicsmagick] (such as `'png'`) is supported. Defaults to `'raw'` for raw framebuffer data. (optional, default `'raw'`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<FramebufferStreamWithMeta>** The possibly converted framebuffer stream. The stream also has a `meta`.:

### screencap

Takes a screenshot in PNG format using the built-in `screencap` utility. This is analogous to `adb shell screencap -p`. Sadly, the utility is not available on most Android `<=2.3` devices, but a silent fallback to the `client.framebuffer()` command in PNG mode is attempted, so you should have its dependencies installed just in case.

Generating the PNG on the device naturally requires considerably more processing time on that side. However, as the data transferred over USB easily decreases by ~95%, and no conversion being required on the host, this method is usually several times faster than using the framebuffer. Naturally, this benefit does not apply if we're forced to fall back to the framebuffer.

For convenience purposes, if the screencap command fails (e.g. because it doesn't exist on older Androids), we fall back to `client.framebuffer(serial, 'png')`, which is slower and has additional installation requirements.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** The PNG stream.

### openLocal

Opens a direct connection to a unix domain socket in the given path.

#### Parameters

*   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The path to the socket. Prefixed with `'localfilesystem:'` by default, include another prefix (e.g. `'localabstract:'`) in the path to override.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** The connection (i.e. \[`net.Socket`]\[node-net]). Read and write as you please. Call `conn.end()` to end the connection.

### openLocal2

Testing only

#### Parameters

*   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** 

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<PromiseDuplex\<Duplex>>** 

### openLog

Opens a direct connection to a binary log file, providing access to the raw log data. Note that it is usually much more convenient to use the `client.openLogcat()` method, described separately.

#### Parameters

*   `name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The name of the log. Available logs include `'main'`, `'system'`, `'radio'` and `'events'`.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** The binary log stream. Call `log.end()` when you wish to stop receiving data.

### openTcp

Opens a direct TCP connection to a port on the device, without any port forwarding required.

#### Parameters

*   `port` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The port number to connect to.
*   `host` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)?** Optional. The host to connect to. Allegedly this is supposed to establish a connection to the given host from the device, but we have not been able to get it to work at all. Skip the host and everything works great.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** The TCP connection (i.e. \[`net.Socket`]\[node-net]). Read and write as you please. Call `conn.end()` to end the connection.

### openMonkey

Starts the built-in `monkey` utility on the device, connects to it using `client.openTcp()` and hands the connection to \[adbkit-monkey]\[adbkit-monkey], a pure Node.js Monkey client. This allows you to create touch and key events, among other things.

For more information, check out the \[adbkit-monkey]\[adbkit-monkey] documentation.

#### Parameters

*   `port`  Optional. The device port where you'd like Monkey to run at. Defaults to `1080`. (optional, default `1080`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<MonkeyClient>** The Monkey client. Please see the \[adbkit-monkey]\[adbkit-monkey] documentation for details.

### openLogcat

Calls the `logcat` utility on the device and hands off the connection to \[adbkit-logcat]\[adbkit-logcat], a pure Node.js Logcat client. This is analogous to `adb logcat -B`, but the event stream will be parsed for you and a separate event will be emitted for every log entry, allowing for easy processing.

For more information, check out the \[adbkit-logcat]\[adbkit-logcat] documentation.

#### Parameters

*   `options` **{clear: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)?}** Optional. The following options are supported:*   **clear** When `true`, clears logcat before opening the reader. Not set by default. (optional, default `{}`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Logcat>** The Logcat client. Please see the \[adbkit-logcat]\[adbkit-logcat] documentation for details.

### openProcStat

Tracks `/proc/stat` and emits useful information, such as CPU load.
A single sync service instance is used to download the `/proc/stat` file for processing.
While doing this does consume some resources, it is very light and should not be a problem.
/proc/stat is pulled once per sec, and emit a 'load' event.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<ProcStat>** The `/proc/stat` tracker, which is an \[`EventEmitter`]\[node-events]. Call `stat.end()` to stop tracking. The following events are available:*   **load** **(loads)** Emitted when a CPU load calculation is available.
*   **loads** CPU loads of **online** CPUs. Each key is a CPU id (e.g. `'cpu0'`, `'cpu1'`) and the value an object with the following properties:    -   **user** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on user programs.
    -   **nice** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on `nice`d user programs.
    -   **system** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on system programs.
    -   **idle** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent idling.
    -   **iowait** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent waiting for IO.
    -   **irq** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on hardware interrupts.
    -   **softirq** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on software interrupts.
    -   **steal** Percentage (0-100) of ticks stolen by others.
    -   **guest** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent by a guest.
    -   **guestnice** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent by a `nice`d guest.
    -   **total** Total. Always 100.

### clear

Deletes all data associated with a package from the device. This is roughly analogous to `adb shell pm clear <pkg>`.

#### Parameters

*   `pkg` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The package name. This is NOT the APK.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### install

Installs the APK on the device, replacing any previously installed version. This is roughly analogous to `adb install -r <apk>`.

Note that if the call seems to stall, you may have to accept a dialog on the phone first.

#### Parameters

*   `apk` **([string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | ReadStream)** When `String`, interpreted as a path to an APK file. When \[`Stream`]\[node-stream], installs directly from the stream, which must be a valid APK.

#### Examples

```javascript
// This example requires the [request](https://www.npmjs.org/package/request) module. It also doesn't do any error handling (404 responses, timeouts, invalid URLs etc).
import Adb from '@u4/adbkit';
import request from 'request';
import { Readable } from 'stream';

const client = Adb.createClient();

const test = async () => {
  // The request module implements old-style streams, so we have to wrap it.
  try {
    // request is deprecated
    const device = client.getClient('<serial>');
    await device.install(new Readable().wrap(request('http://example.org/app.apk') as any) as any)
    console.log('Installed')
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack)
  }
}
```

```javascript
import Adb from '@u4/adbkit';

const client = Adb.createClient();
const apk = 'vendor/app.apk';

const test = async () => {
    try {
        const devices = await client.listDevices();
        for (const device of devices) {
            await device.getClient().install(apk);
            console.log(`Installed ${apk} on all connected devices`);
        }

### installRemote

Installs an APK file which must already be located on the device file system, and replaces any previously installed version. Useful if you've previously pushed the file to the device for some reason (perhaps to have direct access to `client.push()`'s transfer stats). This is roughly analogous to `adb shell pm install -r <apk>` followed by `adb shell rm -f <apk>`.

Note that if the call seems to stall, you may have to accept a dialog on the phone first.

#### Parameters

*   `apk` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The path to the APK file on the device. The file will be removed when the command completes.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### uninstall

Uninstalls the package from the device. This is roughly analogous to `adb uninstall <pkg>`.

#### Parameters

*   `pkg` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The package name. This is NOT the APK.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### isInstalled

Tells you if the specific package is installed or not. This is analogous to `adb shell pm path <pkg>` and some output parsing.

#### Parameters

*   `pkg` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The package name. This is NOT the APK.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** `true` if the package is installed, `false` otherwise.

### startActivity

Starts the configured activity on the device. Roughly analogous to `adb shell am start <options>`.

#### Parameters

*   `options` **StartActivityOptions** The activity configuration.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** 

### startService

Starts the configured service on the device. Roughly analogous to `adb shell am startservice <options>`.

#### Parameters

*   `options` **StartServiceOptions** The activity configuration.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** 

### syncService

Establishes a new Sync connection that can be used to push and pull files. This method provides the most freedom and the best performance for repeated use, but can be a bit cumbersome to use. For simple use cases, consider using `client.stat()`, `client.push()` and `client.pull()`.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Sync>** The Sync client. See below for details. Call `sync.end()` when done.

### stat

A convenience shortcut for `sync.stat()`, mainly for one-off use cases. The connection cannot be reused, resulting in poorer performance over multiple calls. However, the Sync client will be closed automatically for you, so that's one less thing to worry about.

#### Parameters

*   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The path.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Stats>** An \[`fs.Stats`]\[node-fs-stats] instance. While the `stats.is*` methods are available, only the following properties are supported:*   **mode** The raw mode.
*   **size** The file size.
*   **mtime** The time of last modification as a `Date`.

### stat64

A convenience shortcut for `sync.stat64()`, mainly for one-off use cases. The connection cannot be reused, resulting in poorer performance over multiple calls. However, the Sync client will be closed automatically for you, so that's one less thing to worry about.

#### Parameters

*   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The path.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Stats64>** An \[`fs.Stats`]\[node-fs-stats] instance. While the `stats.is*` methods are available, only the following properties are supported:*   **mode** The raw mode.
*   **size** The file size.
*   **mtime** The time of last modification as a `Date`.

### readdir

A convenience shortcut for `sync.readdir()`, mainly for one-off use cases. The connection cannot be reused, resulting in poorer performance over multiple calls. However, the Sync client will be closed automatically for you, so that's one less thing to worry about.

#### Parameters

### tcpip

Puts the device's ADB daemon into tcp mode, allowing you to use `adb connect` or `client.connect()` to connect to it. Note that the device will still be visible to ADB as a regular USB-connected device until you unplug it. Same as `adb tcpip <port>`.

#### Parameters

*   `port`  Optional. The port the device should listen on. Defaults to `5555`. (optional, default `5555`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)>** The port the device started listening on.

### usb

Puts the device's ADB daemon back into USB mode. Reverses `client.tcpip()`. Same as `adb usb`.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### waitBootComplete

Waits until the device has finished booting. Note that the device must already be seen by ADB. This is roughly analogous to periodically checking `adb shell getprop sys.boot_completed`.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### waitForDevice

Waits until ADB can see the device. Note that you must know the serial in advance. Other than that, works like `adb -s serial wait-for-device`. If you're planning on reacting to random devices being plugged in and out, consider using `client.trackDevices()` instead.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** The device ID. Can be useful for chaining.
