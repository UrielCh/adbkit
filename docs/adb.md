enforce EventEmitter typing

### version

[src/adb/client.ts:64-67](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L64-L67 "Source code on GitHub")

Queries the ADB server for its version. This is mainly useful for backwards-compatibility purposes.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)>** The version of the ADB server.

### connect

[src/adb/client.ts:104-115](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L104-L115 "Source code on GitHub")

Connects to the given device, which must have its ADB daemon running in tcp mode (see `client.tcpip()`) and be accessible on the same network. Same as `adb connect <host>:<port>`.

#### Parameters

*   `host` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The target host. Can also contain the port, in which case the port argument is not used and can be skipped.
*   `port`  Optional. The target port. Defaults to `5555` (optional, default `5555`)

#### Examples

```javascript
// switch to TCP mode and set up a forward for Chrome devtools
import Adb from '@u4/adbkit';
const client = Adb.createClient();
// Note: be careful with using `client.listDevices()` together with `client.tcpip()`
// and other similar methods that modify the connection with ADB. You might have the
// same device twice in your device list (i.e. one device connected via both USB and
// TCP), which can cause havoc if run simultaneously.

const test = async () => {
    try {
        const devices = await client.listDevices();
        for (const device of devices) {
            const device = client.getDevice(device.id);
            const port = await device.tcpip();
            // Switching to TCP mode causes ADB to lose the device for a
            // moment, so let's just wait till we get it back.
            await device.waitForDevice();
            const ip = await device.getDHCPIpAddress();
            const deviceTCP = await client.connect(ip, port);
            // It can take a moment for the connection to happen.
            await deviceTCP.waitForDevice();
            await deviceTCP.forward('tcp:9222', 'localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote');
            console.log(`Setup devtools on "${id}"`);
        };
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Something went wrong:', err.stack);
    }
};
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true is a new connetion is etablish, or false if already connected.

### disconnect

[src/adb/client.ts:123-135](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L123-L135 "Source code on GitHub")

Disconnects from the given device, which should have been connected via `client.connect()` or just `adb connect <host>:<port>`.

#### Parameters

*   `host` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The target host. Can also contain the port, in which case the port argument is not used and can be skipped. In other words you can just put the `id` you got from `client.connect()` here and it will be fine.
*   `port`  Optional. The target port. Defaults to `5555`. (optional, default `5555`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<DeviceClient>** The disconnected device ID. Will no longer be usable as a `serial` in other commands until you've connected again.

### listDevices

[src/adb/client.ts:141-144](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L141-L144 "Source code on GitHub")

Gets the list of currently connected devices and emulators.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)\<Device>>** An array of device objects. The device objects are plain JavaScript objects with two properties: `id` and `type`.

### listDevicesWithPaths

[src/adb/client.ts:150-153](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L150-L153 "Source code on GitHub")

Like `client.listDevices()`, but includes the "path" of every device.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)\<DeviceWithPath>>** An array of device objects.

### trackDevices

[src/adb/client.ts:160-163](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L160-L163 "Source code on GitHub")

Gets a device tracker. Events will be emitted when devices are added, removed, or their type changes (i.e. to/from `offline`). Note that the same events will be emitted for the initially connected devices also, so that you don't need to use both `client.listDevices()` and `client.trackDevices()`.

Note that as the tracker will keep a connection open, you must call `tracker.end()` if you wish to stop tracking devices.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Tracker>** 

### kill

[src/adb/client.ts:169-172](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L169-L172 "Source code on GitHub")

This kills the ADB server. Note that the next connection will attempt to start the server again when it's unable to connect

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)>** true

### getDevice

[src/adb/client.ts:179-181](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/2c0c608b95db04b63a7f94ca35153a52f49368fd/src/adb/client.ts#L179-L181 "Source code on GitHub")

Get as DeviceClient attached to a device

#### Parameters

*   `serial` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** device serial number

Returns **DeviceClient** DeviceClient attached to a device
