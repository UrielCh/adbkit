### framebuffer

[src/adb/DeviceClient.ts:414-417](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/1e0f0f06a27d0249a71573547d771f3093d993a8/src/adb/DeviceClient.ts#L414-L417 "Source code on GitHub")

Fetches the current **raw** framebuffer (i.e. what is visible on the screen) from the device, and optionally converts it into something more usable by using \[GraphicsMagick]\[graphicsmagick]'s `gm` command, which must be available in `$PATH` if conversion is desired. Note that we don't bother supporting really old framebuffer formats such as RGB\_565. If for some mysterious reason you happen to run into a `>=2.3` device that uses RGB\_565, let us know.

Note that high-resolution devices can have quite massive framebuffers. For example, a device with a resolution of 1920x1080 and 32 bit colors would have a roughly 8MB (`1920*1080*4` byte) RGBA framebuffer. Empirical tests point to about 5MB/s bandwidth limit for the ADB USB connection, which means that it can take ~1.6 seconds for the raw data to arrive, or even more if the USB connection is already congested. Using a conversion will further slow down completion.

#### Parameters

*   `format`  The desired output format. Any output format supported by \[GraphicsMagick]\[graphicsmagick] (such as `'png'`) is supported. Defaults to `'raw'` for raw framebuffer data. (optional, default `'raw'`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<FramebufferStreamWithMeta>** The possibly converted framebuffer stream. The stream also has a `meta`.:

### screencap

[src/adb/DeviceClient.ts:428-436](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/1e0f0f06a27d0249a71573547d771f3093d993a8/src/adb/DeviceClient.ts#L428-L436 "Source code on GitHub")

Takes a screenshot in PNG format using the built-in `screencap` utility. This is analogous to `adb shell screencap -p`. Sadly, the utility is not available on most Android `<=2.3` devices, but a silent fallback to the `client.framebuffer()` command in PNG mode is attempted, so you should have its dependencies installed just in case.

Generating the PNG on the device naturally requires considerably more processing time on that side. However, as the data transferred over USB easily decreases by ~95%, and no conversion being required on the host, this method is usually several times faster than using the framebuffer. Naturally, this benefit does not apply if we're forced to fall back to the framebuffer.

For convenience purposes, if the screencap command fails (e.g. because it doesn't exist on older Androids), we fall back to `client.framebuffer(serial, 'png')`, which is slower and has additional installation requirements.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** The PNG stream.

### openLocal

Opens a direct connection to a unix domain socket in the given path.

#### Parameters

*   `path` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The path to the socket. Prefixed with `'localfilesystem:'` by default, include another prefix (e.g. `'localabstract:'`) in the path to override.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** The connection (i.e. \[`net.Socket`]\[node-net]). Read and write as you please. Call `conn.end()` to end the connection.

### openLocal2

[src/adb/DeviceClient.ts:453-465](https://github.com/UrielCh/adbkit/blob/1e0f0f06a27d0249a71573547d771f3093d993a8/src/adb/DeviceClient.ts#L453-L465 "Source code on GitHub")

Opens a direct TCP connection to a port on the device, without any port forwarding required.

#### Parameters

*   `port` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The port number to connect to.
*   `host` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)?** Optional. The host to connect to. Allegedly this is supposed to establish a connection to the given host from the device, but we have not been able to get it to work at all. Skip the host and everything works great.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Duplex>** The TCP connection (i.e. \[`net.Socket`]\[node-net]). Read and write as you please. Call `conn.end()` to end the connection.

Starts the built-in `monkey` utility on the device, connects to it using `client.openTcp()` and hands the connection to \[adbkit-monkey]\[adbkit-monkey], a pure Node.js Monkey client. This allows you to create touch and key events, among other things.

For more information, check out the \[adbkit-monkey]\[adbkit-monkey] documentation.

#### Parameters

*   `port`  Optional. The device port where you'd like Monkey to run at. Defaults to `1080`. (optional, default `1080`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<MonkeyClient>** The Monkey client. Please see the \[adbkit-monkey]\[adbkit-monkey] documentation for details.

Calls the `logcat` utility on the device and hands off the connection to \[adbkit-logcat]\[adbkit-logcat], a pure Node.js Logcat client. This is analogous to `adb logcat -B`, but the event stream will be parsed for you and a separate event will be emitted for every log entry, allowing for easy processing.

For more information, check out the \[adbkit-logcat]\[adbkit-logcat] documentation.

#### Parameters

*   `options` **{clear: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)?}** Optional. The following options are supported:*   **clear** When `true`, clears logcat before opening the reader. Not set by default. (optional, default `{}`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<Logcat>** The Logcat client. Please see the \[adbkit-logcat]\[adbkit-logcat] documentation for details.

Tracks `/proc/stat` and emits useful information, such as CPU load.
A single sync service instance is used to download the `/proc/stat` file for processing.
While doing this does consume some resources, it is very light and should not be a problem.
/proc/stat is pulled once per sec, and emit a 'load' event.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<ProcStat>** The `/proc/stat` tracker, which is an \[`EventEmitter`]\[node-events]. Call `stat.end()` to stop tracking. The following events are available:*   **load** **(loads)** Emitted when a CPU load calculation is available.
*   **loads** CPU loads of **online** CPUs. Each key is a CPU id (e.g. `'cpu0'`, `'cpu1'`) and the value an object with the following properties:    -   **user** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on user programs.
    -   **nice** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on `nice`d user programs.
    -   **system** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent on system programs.
    -   **idle** Percentage (0-100) of ticks spent idling.
